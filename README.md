# Obstacle-Avoidance-Line-Follower-Robot
The Obstacle Avoidance Line Follower Robot is a type of robotic system designed to navigate and follow a specified path while avoiding obstacles along the way. This robot combines the functionalities of a line-following robot, which uses sensors to track and stay on a predefined line or path, and an obstacle avoidance robot, which employs sensors to detect and circumvent obstacles in its environment.

The line-following capability allows the robot to move along a designated path, often following a contrasting colored line on the floor or surface. Sensors, such as infrared or color sensors, detect the line, and the robot's motors are adjusted accordingly to keep it on track.

Additionally, the obstacle avoidance feature equips the robot with sensors like ultrasonic or infrared distance sensors to detect objects or obstacles in its path. When an obstacle is detected, the robot takes evasive action, such as changing direction or stopping, to avoid collision.

The Obstacle Avoidance Line Follower Robot finds applications in various fields, including robotics education, hobby projects, and industrial automation. It showcases the capabilities of intelligent navigation and obstacle detection, making it an interesting and practical project for robotics enthusiasts and learners.
